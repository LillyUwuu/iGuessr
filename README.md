# iGuessr
A basic tool to guess iDevice passwords after they have been exploited to remove the passcode limit. Pretty much like a free alternative to a MFC dongle.
## How does this thing work?
Well its simple, we turn your Arduino into a virtual keyboard that will automatically type in codes from 0000 to 9999, there should also be a display connected to the Arduino that will display what codes it is trying and when the photoresistor detects a change in brightness, the screen will display the last attempted code which should be the iDevices lock code.
